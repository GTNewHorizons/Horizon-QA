# Sequences and timing

`GameTestSequence` schedules actions on future test ticks. Use it when a test needs to do something, wait a bit, then check the result.

## Basic usage

```java
@GameTest(template = "stone_platform", timeoutTicks = 60)
public static void delayedAssert(GameTestHelper helper) {
    helper.startSequence()
        .thenIdle(10)
        .thenExecute(() -> helper.assertBlockPresent(Blocks.stone, helper.pos("corner")))
        .thenSucceed();
}
```

One sequence per test. For an immediate pass use `helper.succeed()` directly.

## Fluent client scenarios

For client tests, start with `ClientTest.scenario(helper)`. It authors the same `GameTestSequence` while scheduling client work through the test's single client session:

```java
ClientTarget apply = ClientTarget.of("settings.apply", c -> findApplyControl(c));
ClientTest.scenario(helper)
    .server("prepare fixture", () -> prepareFixture(helper))
    .useHeldItem()
    .awaitScreen(SettingsScreen.class)
    .click(apply)
    .awaitServer("settings applied", () -> assertApplied(helper))
    .capture("applied")
    .succeed();
```

The screen, target lookup and fixture methods belong to the consumer. The chain registers deferred steps. It does not access the GUI during authoring. Do not also create another sequence or attach another client session.

- `client(label, action)` runs once at client END.
- `awaitClient(label, assertion)` retries client assertions, keeping at most one attempt in flight.
- `server(label, action)` runs once at server END.
- `awaitServer(label, assertion)` retries assertions at server END.
- `async(label, action)` and `awaitAsync(label, assertion)` expose the existing completion-stage operations. Their callbacks start on the server thread. Use the supplied session's queued methods for client work.

Client operations and assertion waits default to 100 ticks per step. `defaultTimeoutTicks(n)` changes subsequent defaults. `withinTicks(n)` overrides the next bounded step only, and `step(label)` overrides the next diagnostic label. The overall test timeout still applies. A synchronous `server` action cannot consume a tick budget.

For existing phase operations, obtain `scenario.serverSequence()`, register those steps, then continue the same scenario. Clear pending step overrides first and retain the START/END ordering described below. Finish with `scenario.succeed()`. Low-level `ClientTest.attach(helper)` and direct sequence authoring remain available for advanced consumers.

| `thenWaitUntil(Runnable)`                  | END   | Retry while the callback throws `AssertionError` |
| `thenWaitUntilAtStart(Runnable)`           | START | Same, before world tick                       |
| `thenWaitUntilAtEnd(Runnable)`             | END   | Alias of `thenWaitUntil`                      |
| `thenWaitUntil(maxTicks, Runnable)`        | END   | Retry assertion failures for at most `maxTicks` |
| `thenWaitUntilAtStart(maxTicks, Runnable)` | START | Same, before world tick                       |
| `thenWaitUntilAtEnd(maxTicks, Runnable)`   | END   | Alias of bounded `thenWaitUntil`              |
| `thenSucceed()`                            | END   | Pass the test                                 |
| `thenFail(msg)`                            | END   | Fail the test                                 |

## Tick phases

`thenExecuteAsync(label, maxTicks, supplier)` invokes a supplier of `CompletionStage<?>` once at END and waits without blocking. `thenWaitUntilAsync(label, maxTicks, supplier)` retries completed assertion failures, keeping at most one operation in flight. Unexpected exceptions preserve their original cause. The budget includes time in flight, and the next step starts only after completion is consumed on the server thread. See [Automated client tests](ci.md#automated-client-tests) for their fluent client authoring surface and advanced use.

Every server tick has a START phase and an END phase. World logic (tile entity updates, hopper transfers, machine processing) runs between them.

Default sequence methods run at END, so assertions see the world after it has ticked. Use the `AtStart` variants to deliver input before the world ticks, which is what you want when testing machines that consume their input during the tick.

    accTitle: START, world, and END phase order
    accDescr: The test registers work before tick one. Each tick runs START actions, world logic, END actions, and then the timeout check.
    participant Body as Test body
    participant Start as START phase
    participant World as Minecraft world logic
    participant End as END phase

    Body->>Start: Register callbacks and sequence steps before tick 1
    loop Each counted test tick
        Start->>Start: Advance clock, delayed actions, START steps
        Start->>World: Continue the server tick
        World->>End: Blocks and machines expose updated state
        End->>End: enabled onEachTick callbacks, succeedWhen, END steps
        End->>End: Check timeout last
    end
```

```java
// insert at START so the machine sees it during the tick, assert at END
helper.startSequence()
    .thenExecuteAtStart(() -> ioport.setInventorySlotContents(0, cell.copy()))
    .thenExecute(() -> {
        helper.assertNull(ioport.getStackInSlot(0));
        helper.assertTrue(ItemStack.areItemStacksEqual(ioport.getStackInSlot(6), cell));
    })
    .thenSucceed();
```

### Phase ordering

Within one scheduled tick, START must come before END. The builder throws `IllegalStateException` if you try to go the other way:

```java
helper.startSequence()
    .thenExecute(assertion)
    .thenExecuteAtStart(stimulus);  // throws: START cannot follow END in the same tick
```

Use `thenIdle(1)` to push the START event to the next tick:

```java
helper.startSequence()
    .thenExecute(assertion)
    .thenIdle(1)
    .thenExecuteAtStart(nextStimulus);
```

## Setup code and `startSequence`

The test body runs immediately when the test starts, before the first counted tick. A leading `thenExecuteAtStart` runs at START of tick 1, and a leading `thenExecute` runs at END of tick 1. Structural setup usually belongs before `startSequence()` so the sequence can focus on stimulus and assertions:

```java
@GameTest(template = "stone_platform")
public static void example(GameTestHelper helper) {
    helper.setBlock(0, 1, 0, Blocks.chest);
    helper.startSequence()
        .thenWaitUntil(() -> helper.assertBlockPresent(Blocks.chest, 0, 1, 0))
        .thenSucceed();
}
```

## `thenIdle` counts ticks, not gaps

Ticks are author-facing and 1-based. `thenIdle(1)` advances one counted tick from the current sequence point; between two events, that means the next event lands on the next tick.

END-phase sequence actions scheduled on the timeout boundary are evaluated before the test is marked timed out. For example, `thenIdle(40).thenSucceed()` passes at END of tick 40 with `timeoutTicks = 40`.

START-phase actions after an initial idle run before the next world tick after that many ticks have elapsed. For example, `thenIdle(40).thenExecuteAtStart(...)` targets START of tick 41, so it is outside a `timeoutTicks = 40` window.

## Assertions inside thenExecute

Throw any `AssertionError` subclass. It propagates through the sequence and fails the test with the usual
position and throwable type. Reports add the active step number, label, kind, phase, and declaration
source without wrapping or replacing that original failure.

## Prefer state polling over fixed delays

```java
.thenWaitUntil(500, () -> gtnh.assertMachineFormed(controller))
```

is more reliable than `thenIdle(fixedRecipeLength)`. See [Design principle 4](../contributing/principles.md).

Wait steps retry only `AssertionError`, which includes Horizon-QA assertion failures. A runtime exception or another error fails the test immediately instead of being treated as a condition that may become true later.

Bounded waits attempt their condition once per matching phase, including both their first and final scheduled ticks. If the final attempt still throws an assertion, the test fails immediately with the step number, declaration callsite, attempt count, and latest assertion message. When the condition succeeds, the sequence continues immediately at the next legal phase. Add an explicit `thenIdle(...)` when a test intentionally needs fixed spacing or a minimum observation period; an idle following a wait is measured from the tick when that wait actually completes.

Optional labels make failure output easier to scan:

```java
helper.startSequence()
    .thenWaitUntil("network becomes active", 100, () -> assertNetworkActive(controller))
    .thenExecute("install encoded pattern", () -> installPattern(pattern))
    .thenWaitUntil("crafted output reaches storage", 260, () -> assertStored(output))
    .thenSucceed();
```

Unlabeled steps are still identified automatically by their sequence index and source file line. Sequence state is
also available through `getSteps()` and `getActiveStep()` for investigation tooling.

## Step events and failure context

Every step emits one `SequenceStepStarted` event when it first becomes active and one
`SequenceStepFinished` event when it completes or fails. A wait that retries for many ticks still emits
only that single pair. Its finish event retains the total attempt count and elapsed outer-test ticks as
structured fields, while its human-readable summary omits timing for immediate steps and shows only the
elapsed ticks when the counts are equal. Pending steps that never start do not emit a start event.

Use labels for stable, readable automation output. An unlabeled event falls back to its declaration
source. Event lines are included in JUnit `<system-out>`, each status JSON test's optional `output` array,
and failed-case console tails when event recording is enabled. Horizon-QA deliberately does not emit an
event for every wait attempt.

The examples mod's optional
[`simpleFail`](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Horizon-QA/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/com/gtnewhorizons/horizonqa/examples/tests/BasicTests.java)
case is a runnable demonstration of labelled sequence failure output.

## Interaction with warp

`runRecipe` and `fastForwardTicks` advance the event recorder clock, not the sequence scheduler. The two clocks are independent. When reading timing logs, check which clock an event came from before drawing conclusions.

## Choosing the right tool

|                    | Use when                                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onEachTick`       | Something must hold true on every tick or during a scoped window |
| `GameTestSequence` | Server steps need to happen in order with bounded waits or phase-specific actions |
| `ClientScenario` | Client input and assertions need to be mixed with server steps on the same sequence |
| `succeedWhen`      | Waiting for a single condition to become true              |
